* This is a data science project done with the skills and data acquired from the data science program at ExploreAI Academy.
* We use python to build an ML model for predicting loan sizes.

* We will be using the `personal_loans` dataset which contains data of **bank customers**. The data includes basic information of each customer as well as whether the customer took out a loan and the size of that loan.

The basic information consists of:
   * **Age** - Customer's age in years 
   * **Experience** - working experience in years
   * **Income** - annual income expressed in multiples of 1000
   * **Family** - members in family including the customer self
   * **CCAvg** - average monthly spend on credit card
   * **Education** - Undergrad/Postgrad/Professional
   * **Mortgage** - amount expressed in multiples of 1000'
   * **Securities Account** - whether the customer has a securities account
   * **CD Account** - whether the customer has a cash deposit account
   * **Online** - whether the customer is using online banking
   * **Gender** - Male/Female
   * **Area** - Geographic area where the customer lives 
   * **Personal Loan** - whether the person took out a personal loan
   * **Loan Size** - amount expressed in multiples of  1000
